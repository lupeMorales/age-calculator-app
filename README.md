## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out a age calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
- Any field is empty when the form is submitted
- The day number is not between 1-31
- The month number is not between 1-12
- The year is in the future
- The date is invalid, e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Bonus: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted
